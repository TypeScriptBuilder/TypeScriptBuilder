# Dependencies

Here we mention some of the dependencies and what we use them for:

* codemirror: the text editor.
* webpack: module loader / bundler.
* react: main ui framework
* radium: provides css style sheet features using just JavaScript
* free-style: a better alternative to radium. [See this blog post about it](https://medium.com/@basarat/css-modules-are-not-the-solution-1235696863d6#.ar4ydjv4m).
* marked: markdown parser (markdown -> html)
